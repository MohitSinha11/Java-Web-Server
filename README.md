## 🚀 Features

### 🧩 1. Single Threaded Web Server
- Handles one client request at a time.
- Easy to understand and best for learning socket programming.
- Blocks when multiple clients connect simultaneously.

### ⚙️ 2. Multi Threaded Web Server
- Spawns a **new thread for each client connection**.
- Handles multiple clients concurrently.
- Improves performance compared to the single-threaded version.

- Multithreading using the `Thread` class
- Basic HTTP request handling
- Client-server communication model
